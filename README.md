Road safety is a major concern that affects each one of us on the road.

Seatbelt non-compliance and handbrake oversight are common road safety 
challenges that can lead to accidents and injuries.

"Safe Driving Assurance" is a proactive solution designed to tackle road safety 
challenges by implementing smart technology and real-time safety checks.

By integrating the LPC2129 microcontroller, we've developed a cutting-edge 
seatbelt and handbrake verification system.

Objectives:

1) To prioritize driver safety and the safety of passengers by ensuring critical safety 
measures are met before starting the vehicle.
2) To develop a robust real-time verification system that instantly checks the status 
of the seatbelt and handbrake before starting the engine.
3) To ensure that the engine starts only when both the seatbelt is fastened and the 
handbrake is released, minimizing the risk of unsafe driving conditions.
4) To contribute to reducing road accidents by addressing common issues related to 
seatbelt non-compliance and handbrake oversight.
5) To leverage the capabilities of the LPC2129 microcontroller to efficiently process 
sensor data and make real-time decisions.
